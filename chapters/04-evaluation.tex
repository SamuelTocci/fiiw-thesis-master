\chapter{Evaluation}

Here we will talk about imoprtant metrics and how we can evaluate our system. \\
Important metrics could include processor utilization, scalability, bottlenecks(BW or compute) \\
Tests that we use to check accuracy/memory efficiency or resources \\
What input types did we test? \\ 
Comparision with other systems like intel's SIMD extention (maybe on a standard CPU) \\
