\chapter{Discussion}
- What are the challenges/limitations? (strided convolutions, non-structured matrices (weakly scalable algorithm))\\
- Discuss whether a similar architecture with simd processors can incorporate the algorithm in a similar way. \\ 
- Were we able to generalize the algorithm to domains not explored before ?  \\ 
- Make suggestions for future researchers (bottlenecks, other methods ...) \\
- Reflect on our approach, where could we have won time and better spent it? \\ 
- Limititations to our approach
