\chapter{Introduction}
Hardware acceleration/Matrix multiplication and why it's important and the different fields it's used in. \\

Why is the algorithm from the paper feasable? 
Mention why reducing the amount of element wise multiplications is 
beneficial for program efficiency at the cost of more 
elementwise additions in the case of Toeplitz matrix multiplications.
\section{Structured Matrices - Toeplitz} 
Brief introduction to structured matrices and specificially 
the Toeplitz. Here we show the important properties and characterestics 
of a Toeplitz that we exploit in the project. 
\section{Decomposition alorithm}
Brief explanation of the algorithm we're implementing and reference 
to original Hasan and Fan paper. 
\section{Requirements analysis}
Here we talk about why the problem we pose is significant and describe the use case of 
Toeplitz matrices arising from convolutional unrolling.
